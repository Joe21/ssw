This was my first project thrown together in under 48 hours after my original project had to be scrapped. It was originally designed to only possess [C]reate & [R]ead functionality. After completing all the elements required for a Minimum Viable Product, I hacked away to try to add further functionality. Despite going against all conventional norms of proper coding, it was a very fun exercise where I devised creative dirty hacks to compensate for the lack of RESTful routing. A great learning experience and quite the whimsical use of multi-dimensional arrays rather than the model's unique ID keys.

### **SSW** is a web application derived from a real life scenario to assist individuals with smoking cessation programs by providing user's the ability to track smoking habits along with lifestyle variables.

The SSW App allows users to create a daily smoker's log. The log captures the amount of cigarettes smoked that day, along with the amount of hours slept the previous night. In addition, the app utilizes the Yahoo Weather API to capture and record the daily temperature at the Flatiron District.
